THIS TOOLBOX IS BECOMING UNSUPPORTED, IN FAVOUR OF THE PYTHON VERSION, WHICH ALSO HAS EXPANDED FUNCTIONALITY: https://github.com/vidaurre/glhmm
CHECK ALSO FOR AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL BASED ON DEEP LEARNING: https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-dynamics

**HMM-MAR**

Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki) for the latest documentation, including some basic introduction to the method. If you have problems or questions, use the [Issues](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/issues) tab on github, so that others can see the response as well; but please first check if the question has been responded already [here](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).   

Note: the name of the toolbox is mantained only for historical reasons, and currently contains other observation models other than the multivariate autoregressive model (MAR).

The example scripts provide some basic demonstration of the toolbox functionality. The script examples/run_HMMMAR.m is a template script that specifies some basic options depending on the specified data modality and, provided that the user has already loaded the data in the right format (see the script for details), runs the HMM-MAR and gets some basic information out of the estimation. The script examples/run_HMMMAR_2.m is a template script that generates some random (putatively fMRI) data under two different conditions, estimates the HMM for a number of different configurations, does permutation testing to test the results against the conditions, and plots the results.

Under _examples/_, there are scripts demonstrating the analysis conducted for some of the papers
