function [S,assig, gamma2] = getGammaSimilarity (gamma1, gamma2)
% Computes a measure of similarity between two sets of state time courses.
% These can have different number of states, but they must have the same
% number of time points. 
% If gamma2 is a cell, then it aggregates the similarity measures across
% elements of gamma2 
% S: similarity, measured as the sum of joint probabilities under the
%       optimal state alignment
% assig: optimal state aligmnent for gamma2 (uses munkres' algorithm)
% gamma2: the second set of state time courses reordered to match gamma1
